I started working with software (professionally) in early 2014 and in the middle of 2017 I began to realize that I didn't know anything about object-oriented programming, functional programming, SOLID and software design patterns. This blog is an attempt to help others find the way to start becoming a better developer.

A list of books that changed my career:

* Effective Java 3rd Edition.
* Domain Driven Design.
* GoF.
* Clean code.
* Object-Oriented Design Heuristics.
