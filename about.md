I started working with software (professionally) in early 2014 and in the middle of 2017 I started getting interested in how to become a better developer. I will write about OOP, FP, SOLID, software design patterns and eventually my personal experience in the software industry.

A list of books that changed my career:

* Effective Java 3rd Edition
* Domain Driven Design
* GoF
* Clean code
* Object-Oriented Design Heuristics
